The goal of this project was to create the weather webpage using Vanilla JavaScript and the OpenWeather API.
The weather webpage allows:
1) to search for the current weather for any city;
2) to find out a 6-day forecast, humidity, wind speed, and information about clouds and rain;
3) to see the weather and the forecast for the user`s current location.

Technologies used:
1. HTML/CSS;
2. Bootstrap;
3. Vanilla JavaScript;
4. OpenWeather API;
